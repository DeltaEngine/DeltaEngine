Delta Engine
============

The Delta Engine is allows you to develop applications and especially games for many different platforms (mobile, tablets, console, PC) completely under Windows with .NET by using your favorite tools.

It is free to use on Windows, Open Source and written in C# (.NET). Supported Frameworks: GLFW, OpenTK, SharpDX, SlimDX, XNA and MonoGame. There is also a native C++ version available at https://github.com/DeltaEngine/DeltaEngineCpp

This release uses NuGet to get all required dependencies, except MonoGame (you can also get the Delta Engine itself via NuGet). Only the .NET Framework 4 Client Profile is required.

We also recommend Visual Studio 2012 or 2013 (e.g. the Express version). For additional tips see: http://deltaengine.net/learn/startingwithcsharp
